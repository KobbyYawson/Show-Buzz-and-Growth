# Social Buzz Content Category Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involved analyzing the top 5 content categories for Social Buzz, a rapidly growing social media and content creation platform. The analysis was conducted using Excel, where multiple datasets were cleaned and merged to identify the categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

## Client Background

Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a major social media conglomerate, one from London and the other from San Francisco. The company was created with a vision to prioritize content, keeping users anonymous and emphasizing user reactions. With over 500 million active users monthly and 100,000 pieces of content posted daily, Social Buzz has scaled quickly and is now seeking external expertise for further growth and a successful IPO.

## Project Scope

The initial engagement with Social Buzz focused on the following key areas:

1. **Audit of Big Data Practices:** Reviewing and providing recommendations on how to manage their vast and complex data more effectively.
2. **IPO Preparation:** Offering guidance and best practices to ensure a smooth IPO process by the end of next year.
3. **Content Category Analysis:** Identifying the top 5 content categories based on aggregate popularity.

## Deliverables

- **PowerPoint Presentation:** A slide deck that presents the findings of the content category analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted in Excel, involving the cleaning of multiple datasets and merging three of them into a final dataset for analysis.

## Tools Used

- **Excel:** For data cleaning, merging, visualisation and analysis.

## Conclusion

This project successfully identified the top 5 content categories for Social Buzz, providing valuable insights to help them focus on the most popular content types. The analysis and presentation will support Social Buzz in making data-driven decisions as they prepare for their IPO and continue to scale their platform.
